<p>Casablanca is a beautiful city full of delicious food, kind people, and beautiful sights. It’s a lovely coastal city that offers unique experiences to all of those who travel there. Here are a few reasons why you should travel to Casablanca
</center>
  <h2 style="color:rgb(53, 23, 109);" > markets</h2>
  
  <p>There are so many outdoor markets that give Casablanca its bustling atmosphere. Being on the coast, you’re bound to find fresh fish that you can buy from a vendor, and then have cooked at a nearby grill. You also have access to fresh fruits and vegetable you may not be able to taste back home. If you want to avoid high prices, avoid markets clearly targeted at tourists. These will tend to have lots of souvenirs. Of course, you can always try haggling to get the price down.</p>
  
  <h2 style="color:rgb(53, 23, 109);">The architecture</h2>
  
  <p>In Casablanca, you will find a surprising amount of art deco architecture, which at one point seemed to consume the city. Unfortunately much of the art deco architecture that once stood has been destroyed with time, but there are still many shining examples that remain. There is also a great deal of French architecture from when France occupied the country. This is a great city for architecture buffs to visit.</p>
  
 <h2 style="color:rgb(53, 23, 109);">The beaches</h2>
  
    
 <p>Morocco has a plethora of beautiful beaches, but some of them are more for seeing than for swimming. The beaches of the Mediterranean may be breathtaking, but they tend to have harsh waters and be fairly rocky. Luckily, the beaches of Casablanca are a bit more family and swimmer friendly, as the water is less rough.</p>
  <h2 style="color:rgb(53, 23, 109);">The cuisine</h2>

  <p>It seems that all food in Morocco is seasoned to perfection. There are plenty of spices that go into each dish to give them their rich, complicated flavor. It also seems as though every dessert is doused in refreshing rose water.</p>
